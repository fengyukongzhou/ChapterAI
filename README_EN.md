## FAQ

1. **Q: Port conflict error on startup?**  
   A: Ensure ports 8000 and 8001 are not in use by other programs. You can run in Command Prompt:
   ```bash
   netstat -ano | findstr :8000
   netstat -ano | findstr :8001
   ```
   Then use Task Manager to end the processes using these ports.

2. **Q: How to view service logs?**  
   A: Service logs will be displayed in the Command Prompt window when the service starts.

3. **Q: Python not installed or incorrect version?**  
   A: Download and install Python 3.8 or higher from the [Python website](https://www.python.org/downloads/). Make sure to check "Add Python to PATH" during installation.
